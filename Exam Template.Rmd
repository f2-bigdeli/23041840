# Background to the research

The head of school for a four year degree course has provided you with some data based on student demographics, marks and graduate outcomes. 

They have asked you if the data could reveal findings that may be relevant for monitoring student performance and outcomes.


# Data instructions

Your individual data set is contents.csv file.

You must only analyse the specified data. No other data is to be used for this assessment.

All data manipulation and analyses must be done within R.

# Data structure

The variables collected for each student are:

studentID – a unique student identifier issued to each student at the start of the course

outcome – employment status one year after finishing the course (E1 = employed in a graduate role, E2 =Employed in a non-graduate role, Education = in full time further education, Unemployed = not yet employed)

age – age at start of course

gender – gender at start of course

language – score given for student level of English proficiency determined as part of the application process for the course (minimum 0, maximum 10)

feedback – score given by student for their satisfaction of the course when asked at the end of Year 4 (minimum 0, maximum 10)

Mark1 - Mark for Year 1 (out of 100)

Mark2 - Mark for Year 2 (out of 100)

# QUESTIONS START HERE

# Question 1: Data Preparation 

a) Ensure you have prepared your knitted Word document as per Instructions to Students

b) You should load the data in R, describe and perform any actions with respect to:

-any manipulation of the data structure

-missing values

-ensuring data is valid

**(10 marks)**

### Answer:
# I began the data cleaning process by conducting an initial exploration of the entire dataset through summarization. After reviewing the summary and dataset structure, I decided on specific data cleaning approaches to prepare the data for analysis.
# For handling missing values in the "language" and "feedback" columns, I chose to impute them with the mean value of each respective column. This approach was favored over other methods, such as removing rows with missing values, primarily because a significant number of rows contained NA values, and I aimed to utilize the available data values on these rows. Additionally, both "language" and "feedback" are continuous variables, making mean imputation a suitable choice.
# The "age" variable did not have a specified acceptable range, so I assumed that individuals of all ages could participate in this course and set a upper limit of 100. Upon filtering the data, I found only one observation that exceeded this range. In such cases, removing the outlier is a practical solution, since the proportion of missing values is small and distributed randomly.
# To ensure the dataset's cleanliness and readiness for analysis, I employed the "assert" and "verify" functions. This systematic data cleaning approach aimed to enhance the dataset's quality and reliability, setting a solid foundation for subsequent analyses.

# load the dataset here
student_performance <- read.csv("E:/R/data/contents.csv") #change it based on file address on your system

# Based on the summarized data, there are NA values in the "language" and "feedback" columns, and there is an out-of-range value (max value) in the "age" column.

# Count missing values in the "language" and "feedback" columns

# Question 2 

A colleague suggests the following research question,

 “do students perform differently in their final year relative to their performance at the start?”

To assess this research question:

- create a new variable for the difference between Year 4 mark and Year 1 Mark.

- show and interpret a confidence interval for the mean difference, in context of the research question.

**(12 marks)**

### Answer: 

```{r Q2}

# Calculate the difference between Year 4 and Year 1
student_dataset$Year1vs4_difference <- student_dataset$Year4 - student_dataset$Year1

# Calculate the mean difference
mean_difference <- mean(student_dataset$Year1vs4_difference)

# Calculate the confidence interval
confidence_interval <- t.test(student_dataset$Year1vs4_difference)$conf.int

# Print the results
cat("Mean Difference:", round(mean_difference, 2), "\n")
cat("Confidence Interval:", round(confidence_interval[1], 2), "to", round(confidence_interval[2], 2), "\n")

```
# Interpretation:
# The results show that, on average, students performance in their final year is approximately 1.22 points lower than their performance at the start.
# The confidence interval provides additional information. It suggests that we can be reasonably confident that the true mean difference in performance between Year 4 and Year 1 lies between -1.56 and -0.87 points. This means that, based on the data, we can say with a certain level of confidence that the performance decline in Year 4, relative to Year 1, is statistically significant and likely falls within this range. This suggests that there is evidence to conclude that students' performance has changed over the years, as the confidence interval does not include zero. "
# In the context of the research question, these results indicate that there is a noticeable decrease in students performance from the beginning to the final year of their study, and this decrease is statistically supported by the confidence interval.


# Question 3

Another research question is suggested, 

“is there a relationship between student marks across each of the years?”

- Assess this research question by showing and interpreting the linear correlations between the marks for each of the four years.

Marks are awarded for well-designed output, and the interpretation of the output.

**(12 marks)**

### Answer:

```{r Q3}
# Calculate the correlation matrix 
cor_matrix <- cor(student_dataset[, c("Year1", "Year2", "Year3", "Year4")])

# Create a correlation plot to show correlation values
corrplot(cor_matrix, method="number")
```

# Interpretation:
# the correlation coefficients suggest that there are varying degrees of positive linear relationships between marks in different years. The relationships are moderate in some cases (Year1 & Year2, Year1 & Year3, Year2 & Year3) since the correlation coefficients are between 0.4 to 0.6 and weak or almost non-existent in others (Year1 & Year4, Year2 & Year4, Year3 & Year4) since the correlation coefficients are less than 0.4. 
# Based on these results, we observed weaker correlations for Year 4 marks with all other years. Therefore, Year 4 appears to be less influenced by the academic performance of previous years compared to how Year 1, Year 2, and Year 3 are influenced. One possible interpretation is that students' marks in year 4 are influenced by some external factors such as their motivation based on their plan for their future or their attention to the job market, which causes them to focus less on lessons.
# In summary, the weaker correlations between Year 4 marks and those of previous years suggest that Year 4 performance is influenced by a unique set of factors or requirements, which may not be strongly tied to the linear progression of academic performance seen in earlier years. It highlights the distinct nature of Year 4 in the academic journey of students.

# Question 4

A further research question states, 

“can the final year mark be predicted based on one mark for a previous year?”

Produce simple linear regression with Year 4 mark as the dependent variable, and only one independent variable.

Your answer should include:

- justification for the choice of explanatory variable, including any additional supporting exploratory data analyses used to make the choice;

- interpretation of the slope (gradient) coefficient;

- comment on the r-square value, and the validity of model assumptions.


**(23 marks)**

### Answer:

```{r Q4}
# Simple linear regression with Year 4 as the dependent variable
model_simple1 <- lm(Year4 ~ Year1, data = student_dataset)
model_simple2 <- lm(Year4 ~ Year2, data = student_dataset)
model_simple3 <- lm(Year4 ~ Year3, data = student_dataset)

# Compare models by AIC method
extractAIC(model_simple1)
extractAIC(model_simple2)
extractAIC(model_simple3)

# Based on correlation coefficients and AIC, I chose Year 3 as the explanatory variable
summary(model_simple3)

# Print of the slope coefficient and R-squared value
slope <- coef(model_simple3)["Year3"]
cat("The slope (gradient) coefficient is:", round(slope, 4), "\n")

r_squared <- summary(model_simple3)$r.squared
cat("The R-squared value is:", round(r_squared, 4), "\n")

```
# Interpretation:
# I chose Year3 as the independent variable for predicting Year4 marks because it not only had a relatively higher correlation with Year4 marks (based on results for Question 3) but also resulted in the lowest AIC value among the three models. This indicates that Year3 is a better predictor of Year4 compared to Year1 or Year2, and it provides a more favorable goodness of fit.
# The estimated slope coefficient (approximately 0.2286) means that for every one-point increase in a student's Year 3 marks, we can expect an increase of approximately 0.2286 points in their Year 4 marks, assuming a linear relationship between the two variables.
# The R-squared value, which measures the proportion of variability in Year 4 marks explained by Year 3 marks, is approximately 0.0567 (or 5.67%). This suggests that only a small fraction of the variation in Year 4 marks can be explained by Year 3 marks alone. In other words, Year 3 marks are not a strong predictor of Year 4 marks, as indicated by the low R-squared value.
# The p-value is 0.00023 (much less than 0.05). This low p-value indicates that there is a statistically significant relationship between Year 3 marks and Year 4 marks. It means that it's unlikely to observe such a relationship due to random chance alone.
# In summary, the analysis suggests that while there is a statistically significant relationship between Year 3 marks and Year 4 marks, the strength of this relationship is relatively weak (as indicated by the low R-squared value). Therefore, predicting a student's Year 4 marks solely based on their Year 3 marks may not be very accurate or reliable. Other factors not included in this model may also influence Year 4 performance.


# Question 5:  Report


Clearly state one **alternative new** research question based on the full original data set supplied to you. Explain why this is a worthwhile research question to consider.

You are required to write a short report for the client showing some analyses based only on the research question you have selected.

### Answer:

```{r Q5}
# Research question: "does language proficiency impact academic performance and consequently future outcomes in students?"

# For this research question, I used the cleaned dataset obtained from the results of question 1, since the data cleaning and preparation process on the full original dataset would be the same, therefore I didn't repeat it.

# Creating a new variable "Mark" by calculating the average of the four "Year" variables (Year1, Year2, Year3, Year4).
# This provides a single measure of student performance across multiple years.

# Report
# Introduction: This research study aims to explore the factors that influence student performance, as I know this matter is of great significance for educational institutions and stakeholders. In particular, I investigate the impact of students' language proficiency, measured by the "language" variable, on their academic performance represented by the "Mark" variable. To facilitate this analysis, a new variable, "Mark," was created by averaging the values from four "Year" columns. Understanding the influence of language skills on academic outcomes is vital, as language proficiency is fundamental for effective communication and comprehension. Additionally, I examine the relationship between students' performance and their educational outcomes.
# The hypothesis testing results indicated a statistically significant positive correlation between language proficiency and academic performance. The simple linear regression model further supported this finding, with a slope coefficient of 0.69 and a small p-value, suggesting that, on average, a one-unit increase in "language" is associated with a 0.69 unit increase in estimated "Mark." However, it's essential to note that the model's R-squared value suggests that "language" explains only approximately 25.72% of the variance in "Mark". This implies that other unaccounted factors may also influence students' performance.
# For a deeper analysis, a multiple linear regression model was constructed, with both "language" and "age" as independent variables. While the R-squared value saw a slight increase, the p-value for the "age" variable (0.0758) exceeded the conventional significance threshold (0.05). Consequently, a stepAIC model confirmed this by showing minimal changes in the AIC value when removing "age" (from 94.233 to 95.434) but a significant increase when removing "language" (from 94.233 to 162.016). Thus, "language" plays a crucial role in the model and should be retained as a significant predictor.
# Visualizations, such as scatter plots, supported the findings by demonstrating that students with stronger language skills tend to perform better academically, as their average marks are higher. Histograms provide a visual representation of the distribution of "language" and "Mark" variables, helping us understand their concentration.
# Additionally, box plots revealed that students with higher marks and superior academic performance are more likely to be employed in graduate roles, highlighting the potential career benefits associated with higher academic achievement. This finding underscores the significance of academic performance in shaping students' future prospects. Therefore, it is essential  to continue investigating the factors that enhance academic performance.
# Exploratory Data Analyses and Limitations: While this report covers essential analyses, further exploratory data analyses could uncover additional insights.  It is essential to recognize the study's limitations. For instance, there may be unmeasured variables that impact student performance, which were not considered in this analysis. Additionally, the study's scope is confined to the available variables, and other unrecorded factors may contribute to variations in student performance. Moreover, it is important to note that linear regression assumes certain conditions like normality and homoscedasticity, which should be considered when interpreting the results.
# Future Research: Given more time, I could extend this research by exploring other factors that may influence students' performance, conducting more advanced statistical analyses, and collecting a larger and more diverse dataset.
